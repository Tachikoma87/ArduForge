# ArduForge

ArduForge is a collection of C++ classes for various common, popular devices used within the Arduino environment. All classes feature extensive in-code documentation, examples, and wiring schematics. I hope this will make it easy to understand how to use the classes and devices. Due to the thorough documentation, this project may also be suitable for teaching electronics to novice users in electronics or students in general.

# List of devices ready to use
* BatteryIndicator - Measure voltage and remaining charge of various types of batteries
* BinarySensor - debounced binary sensor such as a switch or hall sensor
* CC1101 - popular mid-range ISM-band radio transceiver
* HCSR04 - cheap ultrasonic distance measurement device for a distance up to 4 meter
* HM10 - Common Bluetooth module
* MF52 - cheap and popular thermistor
* MPU6050 - very common 6-axis (3 DOF acceleration, 3 DOF rotation) inertial measurement unit (IMU)
* RGBLed - Lightweight class to control an RGB Led with common cathode
* RotaryEncoder - tracks the rotation of a shaft and usually comes with a switch
